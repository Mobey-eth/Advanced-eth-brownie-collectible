 @dev required to make an NFT contract where the token URI can be any one of 3 different dogs
 - Images are randomly selected
 This elaborate project exposed @dev to 
  - IPFS (Inter-Planetary File Storage)
  - Pinata (3rd party IPFS node)
  - Creating Image URI(Uniform Resource Identifier)
  - Creating a token URI() / Metdata
  - Writing Scripts to both set image URI and  token metadata 
  - Worked with the Chainlink VRF (V1)
